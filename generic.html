								<p> 
									A people-oriented Software Developer pursuing MS in Computer Science at San Jose State University(SJSU). I have worked at SJSU Research 
									foundation as a Research Assistant where I managed multiple research projects concurrently and performed data analysis. 
									Before pursuing masters, I was a full-time Software Development Engineer at TCS, where I worked on some cool projects and 
									managed to increase the efficiency of one by about 19%. 
								</p>
									
								<p>
									Prior to that I completed Bachelor's in Computer Engineering from University of Pune. During this time I secured 
									a top 50 spot at TCS Game-on competition, a national level event with over 10,000 participants. I also captained my college soccer team 
									that won several championships and sports meet. I'm passionate about technology and actively seeking full time opportunities in the 
									field of software engineering. I am highly skilled in computer programming with expertise in cloud computing, machine learning, 
									databases, computer networks and operating systems.
								</p>

								<p>
									My research interests involve cloud computing, neural networks, advanced driver assistance systems and IoT. I have published 
									a few research papers on NLP and cybersecurity. Apart from being a passionate footballer, I am also a proactive dancer and a 
									guitarist. Some of my hobbies include reading, listening songs and trying to find out what existed before the big bang!
									(not the web series obviously :D)
