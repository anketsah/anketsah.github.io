#   Portfolio for Developers :star2:

## Site Url: https://anketsah.github.io<br />


A simple and elegant one-pager with a super vibrant color shifting palette (which I guess you can always tone down if it's a little too vibrant for you), 
an in-page navigation bar, a separate generic page template (just in case to elaborate on some point/detail), and an assortment of pre-styled elements.
